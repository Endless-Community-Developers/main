### How do I contribute?

When you are wanting to add new pages, modify pages, etc - please make your changes and create a new branch under the [main branch](https://github.com/Endless-Community-Developers/main). Once you have created a new branch, you can modify or create new docs within the /docs/ directory.

Once you have finished, go to the root of the repo and open a pull request. We will review it, provide any feedback/changes if required then merge your branch into main. Thank you to everyone that decides to contribute to the website.
